# Connect-Four-Game

Connect-Four is a tic-tac-toe-like two-player game in which players alternately place pieces on
a vertical board 7 columns across and 6 rows high. Each player uses pieces of a particular color
(commonly black and red, or sometimes yellow and red), and the object is to be the first to obtain four
pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given
column always drop to the lowest unoccupied row of that column. As soon as a column contains 6
pieces, it is full, and no other piece can be placed in the column.
Both players begin with 21 identical pieces, and the first player to achieve a line of four
connected pieces wins the game. If all 42 men are played and no player has places four pieces in a row,
the game is drawn.

The game is implemented that can be played by:

• a human player vs a human player,

• a human player vs the AI player,

• AI player vs AI player.
